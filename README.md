## Koa Marko Example

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/kristianmandrup/koa-marko-example.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

## Run

`node server.js`

## Design

Showcases simple design of Multi-page Application server using Koa.js server, REST APIs and Marko templating

- fixtures : sample data to simulate REST API calls (for tests)
- /lib : small libraries of functions
  - data.js : page configuration for which data to load
  - render.js : renders page with data (using Marko)
  - util.js : general app utils such as route factory method
- public : static resources

- server.js : server init
- server_config.js : server configuration


## Marko Templating: Async, Out-of Order, Streamed, Compressed Fragments

Marko has several **killer features** that set it apart:

*   Marko offers **streamed** template **rendering**, which **sends** your html **content** to the browser **early** and **often**.
*   Marko supports **asynchronous rendering** of html **fragments**, which basically means you define sections of your template as asynchronous and you _let Marko_ _handle_ the _waiting_, _buffering_ and eventual _rendering_.
*   Marko offers **out of order rendering** while still displaying the html content in _correct order_. This means that as soon as your asynchronous _queries_ _complete_, Marko will _render_ the relevant portions of the template and _send_ it _to_ the _browser_, even if this means sending the content out of the final display sequence. Then Marko displays the content in the correct sequence by using client side JavaScript.
These three **features** in combination **result** in **huge gains** in **perceived** and **actual** loading **performance** particularly when used on multi-page web applications that serves dynamic content.

The **reason** for the significant performance gains is because Marko is **designed** to **leverage Progressive Rendering** in the browser, a feature supported by all modern browsers.

The idea behind Progressive Rendering is that the **browser** should attempt to **paint** or render as much of the **page** as can as **early** as possible.

You should really **watch** to **demo** to get a **sense** of **why** _Progressive Rendering_ and **Marko** are so **important**.
